>It was the 19th of December.
>IHackedWindows read online that there was going to be a furry convention coming up in a week.
>IHackedWindows absolutley hated furries.
>This was his time to shine.
>This time would be the last time furries had a convention, he thought.
>He crafted the "IHW's Furry Convention Massacre Kit" just a month earlier.
>This time he was ready.
>He had thought to himself: "What would be the most efficient way to end a furry convention?"
>"Of course!" he said to himself.
>"I'll place withers around the whole convention!"
>IHW snuck into the convention, placed as manth withers as he could, but, to his surprise, he had been spotted.
>Out of nowhere came a brown, tall and ugly furry, telling IHW to "Stop bullying furries".
>IHackedWindows got so triggered that he shouted: "This is it, furfags, this will be your very last convention.
>Be ready to feel my wrath!"
>IHW tried to summon his withers.
>But it didn't work.
>THE SERVER WAS ON PEACEFULL!
>He decided to go for plan B: Shooting all of the furries.
>He took out his bow, but then, out of nowhere, the FBI suddenly appeared and asked him
>"What the fuck do you think you're doing?"
>IHW replied with: "If furries want to be animals, we should have the right to hunt them."
>The FBI told IHW: "Furries want to be animals, and therefore we have the right to hunt them."
>They continued: "You are, in theory, allowed to hunt furries. But no, you are not LEGALLY allowed to hunt furries.
>Law authorities have this weird law regarding "inhumane actions" or something like that, but it's just a bunch of
>Liberal crap. But ignore the police and hunt down those bastards like it's season."
